    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose** <br>\n",
    "This project consists of analyzing several datasets to help in the research efforts of a new Chicago ride share company. The analysis will provide insights on trends in taxi service including popular service providers and neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets** <br>\n",
    "The datasets used are from data extracted from a website with weather condition information as well as SQL database queriers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset includes taxi companies names and the number of rides they completed on November 15-16, 2017. The secodn dataset used contains drop-off locations in Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended and the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis** <br>\n",
    "The analysis involves creating simple visualizations to identify the most frequently used Taxi services in Chicago and the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs. These visualizations will compare different taxi service providers using bar charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final part of this project includes hypothesis testing using the data from /datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv.\n",
    "This dataset includes information about rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport, including pickup date and time, weather conditions at the time of pickup, and ride duration in seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis to be tested is: \"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting this test will determine whether there is a significant difference between average ride times to the Airport on Saturdays depending on the weather condition. This may be helpful for planning the amount of rides or drivers set out on Saturdays by the taxi service in order to provide the best service and expectation\n",

    "**Test Summary**<br>\n",
    "By conducting Levene's test for equality of variances, I assessed whether the variances of the two groups (no_rain_saturdays and rain_saturdays) are significantly different. The p-value from Levene's test was greater than the significance level of 0.05 (p = 0.53), indicating no significant difference in variances between the groups. Therefore, I assumed equal variances and conducted a two-sample t-test with equal_var=True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-test resulted in the following:\n",
    "T-statistic: -6.946177714041499\n",
    "P-value: 6.517970327099473e-12\n",
    "\n",
    "The results led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport differs significantly between rainy Saturdays and non-rainy Saturdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the Levene test did not show a substantial difference in variances, I opted on the cautious side due to the small sample size (only Saturdays from November 2017). To ensure robustness, I also performed a Welch's t-test, assuming equal_var=False with the same significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from the Welch's test were as follows:\n",
    "T-statistic: -7.186034288068629\n",
    "P-value: 6.738994326108734e-12\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, the null hypothesis was rejected, confirming that the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport differs significantly between rainy Saturdays and non-rainy Saturdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**<br>\n",
    "Although both tests supported the rejection of the null hypothesis, there are limitations to consider. One major limitation is the small sample size, limited to only Saturdays in November. This constraint may introduce biases or inaccuracies, as factors such as specific construction projects or Thanksgiving travel patterns could skew the data. To obtain a more accurate assessment of the significance of the observed differences, a larger sample size spanning various dates throughout the year, with consideration for different weather conditions, would be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the results provide insights into the differences in ride durations based on weather conditions, caution is warranted in interpreting the findings due to the limitations of the dataset."
